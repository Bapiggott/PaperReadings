# UAV Mission Planning System Report

## Overview
This report documents the development of a UAV mission planning system using a structured **prompting framework**, **UAV task categorization**, **API integration**, and **Python-based flight planning**.

The project focused on **enhancing UAV autonomy**, providing structured **flight plans**, and ensuring **logical mission execution**.

---

## 1. **System Prompt Development**

### **Initial Objective**
- Develop a **robust UAV mission planner prompt** to generate flight plans.
- Separate **high-level** and **low-level skills** for UAV control.
- Ensure the response is **structured, logical, and executable**.

### **Final System Prompt (Python Variable Format)**
We created a **comprehensive system prompt** stored as a Python string:

```python
PROMPT = """
You are an advanced UAV mission planner and control assistant. Your role is to analyze the provided task,
interpret the environment, and generate a structured UAV flight plan. You must ensure efficient navigation, 
obstacle avoidance, and adherence to mission requirements while optimizing for safety and energy efficiency.

## Response Guidelines:
1. Prioritize **high-level skills** when possible, but use **low-level skills** when precise control is needed.
2. If the task is unclear, return a **clarifying response**.
3. If an obstacle is detected, **dynamically replan** the path or execute an avoidance maneuver.
4. Ensure logical, **step-by-step mission execution**.
5. Respond **only in a structured flight plan format**.

## UAV Skill Descriptions:

### High-level skills:
- `takeoff()`: Launch UAV into flight.
- `land()`: Descend and safely land.
- `hover(duration)`: Maintain a fixed position for a set duration.
- `navigate_to(x, y)`: Fly to a specified coordinate.
- `follow_route(waypoints)`: Follow a sequence of waypoints.
- `return_home()`: Navigate back to the original launch position and land.
- `plan_path(destination)`: Compute an optimal flight path and follow it.
- `replan_path()`: Recalculate a new route if an obstacle is detected.
- `avoid_obstacle()`: Execute a maneuver to avoid a detected obstacle.

### Low-level skills:
- `move_forward(distance)`: Move forward by a specific distance.
- `move_backward(distance)`: Move backward by a specific distance.
- `move_left(distance)`: Move left by a specific distance.
- `move_right(distance)`: Move right by a specific distance.
- `move_up(distance)`: Move up by a specific distance.
- `move_down(distance)`: Move down by a specific distance.
- `turn_cw(degrees)`: Rotate clockwise by a specified angle.
- `turn_ccw(degrees)`: Rotate counterclockwise by a specified angle.
- `wait(milliseconds)`: Wait for a specified duration.
- `detect_obstacle()`: Check if an obstacle is present.
- `log(message)`: Output a text message to the console.
- `take_picture()`: Capture an image.

## Scene & Execution History
- **Scene Description:** {scene_desc}
- **Task Description:** {prompt}
- **Execution History:** None (if replanning, this field will contain prior steps)

Respond **ONLY with the UAV flight plan as structured Python code**.

## 2. **UAV Task Categorization & Generation**

We generated **50 unique tasks** for each UAV mission category:

### **Categories**
- **Launch/Landing**
- **Hovering**
- **Waypoint Navigation**
- **Following Waypoint Routes**
- **Return to Home (RTH)**
- **Path Planning**
- **Path Replanning**
- **Collision Avoidance**

### **Example Tasks**
```python
uav_tasks = {
    "Launch/Landing": [
        "Take off to 50 meters altitude.",
        "Land on a designated landing pad.",
        "Perform an emergency landing due to low battery.",
        "Hover at 20 meters before landing.",
        "Take off and maintain altitude until further command.",
    ],
    "Collision Avoidance": [
        "Detect and avoid a tree blocking the path.",
        "Perform emergency stop when obstacle detected.",
        "Navigate around a moving vehicle in flight path.",
        "Adjust altitude to avoid low-hanging power lines.",
        "Recalculate flight path to bypass restricted airspace.",
    ]
}
```

## 3. **API Integration for LLM Processing**

We structured an **API request** to process UAV mission planning via **LLM calls**.

```python
import requests

class UAVTaskProcessor:
    def __init__(self, api_url, model_name="uav-mission-model", temperature=0.7):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.temperature = temperature

    def process_task(self, prompt, image_base64="", stream=False):
        system_message = (
            "You are an advanced UAV mission planner and AI assistant. "
            "Your role is to generate structured flight plans for UAV missions, ensuring safety, efficiency, "
            "and dynamic path adjustments when needed."
        )

        options = {
            "temperature": self.temperature,
            "max_tokens": 1024,
        }

        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.api_url}/api/generate",
            json={
                "model": self.model_name,
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
                    {"role": "user", "content": prompt, "images": [image_base64] if image_base64 else [], "format": "json"}
                ],
                "temperature": self.temperature,
                "stream": stream,
                "options": options,
            },
            timeout=999
        )

        return response.json()
```

## 4. **Processing UAV Tasks with LLM**
We created a structured **loop to process tasks category-wise**, ensuring clear separation.

```python
all_results = []
image_index = 0

for category, prompts in uav_tasks.items():
    print(f"
### Processing UAV Category: {category} ###
")
    
    for i, prompt in enumerate(prompts, start=1):
        image_index += 1
        result = process_task(
            prompt=prompt,
            stream=False
        )
        all_results.append(result)
```
