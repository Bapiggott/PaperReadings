## 1. Weekly Progress

### Paper Read
1. **The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks**  
   - Explores potential pitfalls when an agent overthinks high-level reasoning instead of taking actionable steps.
   - Highlights how excessive internal deliberation can hinder timely decisions in real-time or interactive tasks.

### Dataset Creation
- Began creating a dataset for each command; upon review, determined this approach was not ideal.
- However, a complete **format and outline for 25 separate datasets** was created.
- The plan is now under revision to find a different dataset strategy that balances coverage and scalability.

### Task Summary
- **Updated the Drone Task Feasibility Summary** (previously drafted).  
  *See the newly linked file for details on which tasks are fully implementable, which tasks are uncertain, and which tasks are out of scope.*
- Began coding **additional commands** to enhance the **mini-spec capabilities** for new drone tasks.

### Ongoing Challenges
- Developing an **alternative dataset approach** that avoids excessive manual overhead while ensuring diversity and coverage of commands.
- Large-scale code restructuring is required, prompting careful consideration of backward compatibility, testing, and integration points.

## 2. Challenges
- **Dataset Redesign**: The previous plan to create a dedicated dataset per command proved cumbersome. The new approach must still ensure coverage for each command while consolidating overhead.  
- **Code Overhaul**: Updating existing modules to accommodate a new dataset structure has ripple effects on multiple components (parsers, data loading, model calls).
- **Balancing Detail and Efficiency**: Ensuring that tasks and capabilities remain sufficiently detailed for advanced functionalities while maintaining straightforward deployment.

## 3. Tasks for Next Week
- **Finalize Revised Dataset Strategy**: Determine the right balance between specialized coverage and generalized format.  
- **Continue Minispec Updates**: Complete the integration of newly coded commands and ensure they are tested in the current environment.  
- **Synchronize Documentation**: Align code changes with updated summaries, ensuring the final repository references the new drone tasks, dataset approach, and mini-spec definitions.
