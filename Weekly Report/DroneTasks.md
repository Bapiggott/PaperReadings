# Drone Task Feasibility Summary

This document summarizes the various drone task categories described in the reference PDF and indicates which tasks you plan to implement, which you are uncertain about, and which are not applicable given your current setup.

## Overview

Each row in the table below corresponds to a major category from the PDF (Pre-Flight and Setup, Flight and Navigation, and so on). For each category, we list:

1. **User Notes** — Your statements on what you can or cannot implement.  
2. **Feasibility** — A short assessment of whether these features are readily implementable.  
3. **Additional Comments** — Any relevant clarifications or pointers.  
4. **Doc Reference** — Where in the original PDF (tables/sections) the tasks are described.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Pre-flight & Setup**    | - “Can do.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Yes** – Basic calibration, GPS lock, etc.                                   | Straightforward tasks (e.g., calibration, system checks). Likely matches Table 3, Section 3.1.                       | Table 3 (Sec. 3.1)     |
| **Flight & Navigation**   | - Can add: takeoff, landing, hover (velocity=0), navigate to waypoint (x,y,z), return home, follow waypoint route<br/>- Don’t know if we can implement: path planning, object avoidance, path re-planning                         | **Yes** for basic tasks<br/>**Maybe** for path/avoidance                      | You can implement simpler tasks first (go_to_location, RTH). Real-time path re-planning & avoidance requires more advanced sensor data.                    | Table 4 (Sec. 3.2)     |
| **Perception & Sensing**  | - Can add: obstacle detection, object recognition, capture image, capture video<br/>- Don’t know if we can add: object tracking, SLAM, terrain following                                                                          | **Yes** for basic detection<br/>**Maybe** for advanced (SLAM, tracking)       | Capturing images/video is straightforward. Object recognition is possible if you have a trained model. SLAM/tracking need additional code and testing.     | Table 5 (Sec. 3.3)     |
| **Communication**         | - Can add: send telemetry, monitor battery, monitor link, geofence compliance<br/>- Don’t need: receive commands, transmit camera data externally (IsaacSim handles it)<br/>- Don’t know if we can add: emergency landing        | **Yes** for telemetry & battery/link checks<br/>**No** for external streaming<br/>**Maybe** for emergency landing   | Sending status messages, battery levels, geofence checks is doable. Emergency landing requires robust fail-safe triggers if you decide to implement it.     | Table 6 (Sec. 3.4)     |
| **Safety & Health**       | - “Monitor sensors” (IsaacSim validity)                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Yes** – Basic sensor checks                                                 | Overlaps partly with Communication (battery, link monitoring). Safety tasks also include fail-safes (e.g., auto-land) if you choose to implement them.      | Table 6 (Sec. 3.4)     |
| **Advanced Landing**      | - N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **N/A**                                                                       | Precision or vision-based landing (beyond basic landing) is out of scope for your current setup.                                                            | Table 7 (Sec. 3.5)     |
| **Payload Handling**      | - N/A (No payload mechanism)                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **N/A**                                                                       | You do not have physical hardware (servo/winch) to release or carry payloads.                                                                               | Table 7 (Sec. 3.5)     |
| **Swarm / Multi-UAV**     | - N/A (Only one UAV)                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **N/A**                                                                       | Requires multiple drones and specialized coordination software, which you are not using.                                                                    | Table 7 (Sec. 3.5)     |
| **Weather Adaptation**    | - N/A (Not possible with IsaacSim)                                                                                                                                                                                                | **N/A**                                                                       | Weather-based path re-planning or monitoring is not relevant in IsaacSim at this time.                                                                     | Table 7 (Sec. 3.5)     |

## Notes

1. **Basic Tasks** (Pre-flight checks, GPS lock, takeoff, landing, etc.) are straightforward.  
2. **Navigation** can be kept simple by implementing direct waypoint flights, hover, and return-to-home first.  
3. **Advanced Tasks** (such as path re-planning, obstacle avoidance, or SLAM) may require:
   - Additional sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth camera)  
   - Real-time data processing pipelines  
   - AI/ML models for obstacle or object detection.  
4. **Communication & Safety** tasks (battery/link checks, geofence compliance) should be integrated early so the drone can manage fail-safes correctly if anything goes wrong.  
5. **Not Implementing** tasks like advanced landing, payload handling, multi-UAV operations, and weather adaptation is acceptable if you lack hardware or simulation support in IsaacSim for these features.

## Next Steps

- **Implement Core Features**: Start with the basic tasks you can definitely do (Pre-flight, GPS lock, takeoff, waypoint navigation).  
- **Experiment with Sensing**: Test capturing images, object detection, and see if your environment supports easy obstacle detection.  
- **Evaluate Advanced Paths**: Decide if you want to prototype path planning or avoidance.  

Refer to the PDF for more detailed descriptions and pseudocode in the Appendices (Sections A and B). 

**Happy flying!**
